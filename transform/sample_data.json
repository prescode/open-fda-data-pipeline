LOT 8G03354 WAS MANUFACTURED ON JULY 29, 2018 IN THE BODOLAY LINE WITH A TOTAL OF (B)(4) MARKET UNITS. A BATCH RECORD REVIEW ON FEBRUARY 20, 2020, TO VERIFY IF ALL THE APPLICABLE PROCEDURES WERE FOLLOWED AND NO ISSUES WERE FOUND; ALL THE COMPONENTS FOR ASSEMBLY WERE CORRECT PER BILL OF MATERIALS (BOM) AND ALL THE TOOLING INFORMATION DOCUMENTED WAS ALSO CORRECT, UNDER INTERNATIONAL COMMODITY CODE (ICC CODE) 412002 SYSTEM APPLICATION PRODUCTS (SAP) MATERIAL IDENTIFICATION (B)(4) AND MANUFACTURING ORDER (B)(4). THE BATCH RECORD REVIEW SUPPORTS THAT THERE WERE NO DISCREPANCIES RELATED TO THE ISSUE REPORTED. THERE ARE NO PHOTOGRAPHS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CASE AND NO UNUSED RETURN SAMPLE WAS EXPECTED. BASED IN THE ANALYSIS PHASE CONCLUSIONS, THE ISSUE OF BLACK SPOTS ON PRODUCTS REPORTED BY THE CUSTOMERS WAS ATTRIBUTED TO THE FOLLOWING PROBABLE CAUSES: EMBEDDED SPOTS - ALLOWABLE FOR CHEMICAL MANUFACTURING AND CONTROL (CMC) MATERIAL, PRESENT IN ALL DRESSINGS IN VARYING DEGREES AND EVIDENCE OF PECTIN AND PENTALYN CONTRIBUTING TO SPOTS DUE TO CHANGE COLOR. HIGH TEMPERATURE AT MIXER 06 MAY CAUSE MASS BURNED. RESIDUES OF MASS ACCUMULATED IN THE MIXER EXTRUDER SCREWS REACHING TO THE PRODUCT AS PART OF THE NORMAL MIX OF MASS PROCESS. A TARGETED ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FOR THIS KNOWN ISSUE/MALFUNCTION CODE HAS BEEN CONDUCTED. THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS, QUALITY INSPECTIONS, AND QUALITY CONTROL RECORDS WERE REVIEWED. AS PART OF THE ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION, DRESSINGS WITH THE ALLEGED FOREIGN MATTER SPOTS WERE SENT TO AN EXTERNAL LAB TO HAVE THE SPOTS ISOLATED FROM THE DRESSING FOR COMPOSITION TESTING AND ANALYSIS. THE RESULT OF THE ANALYSIS CONCLUDED THAT THE SPOTS WERE A RAW MATERIAL INGREDIENT USED IN THE FORMULATION OF THE HYDROCOLLOID. EFFECTS OF MIXING THE HYDROCOLLOID AT ALLOWABLE TEMPERATURE VARIATIONS WAS PERFORMED AT OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN (B)(6). THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT WITHIN OUR VALIDATED PROCESSING SPECIFICATIONS, THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF SPOTS PRESENT IN THE HYDROCOLLOID COULD VARY BASED ON THE VALIDATED RANGE OF TEMPERATURE AND TIME PROFILES OF THE MIXING PROCESS. THE INVESTIGATION FOUND ONE ROOT CAUSE AND TWO CONTRIBUTING CAUSES FOR THE REPORTED MALFUNCTION AND THEY ARE AS FOLLOWS: ROOT CAUSE: THE VALIDATED ALLOWABLE RANGE FOR THE TEMPERATURE AND TIME PROFILES OF THE MIXING PROCESS ALLOWED FOR A RAW MATERIAL TO BECOME CHARRED DURING THE PROCESS AT THE HIGHER SETTINGS. CONTRIBUTING CAUSES: THE FREQUENCY OF THE MIXER CLEANING WAS NOT ADEQUATE WHEN THE MIXER WAS RUN AT THE UPPER END OF THE VALIDATED SETTINGS. THE MATERIAL SPECIFICATION FOR A POWDERED RAW MATERIAL USED IN THE FORMULATION ALLOW FOR BLACK SPOTS. THE BLACK SPOTS WITHIN THE POWDER CANNOT BE ISOLATED AND REMOVED. THE MATERIAL IS SUPPLIED WITH A CERTIFICATE OF ANALYSIS GUARANTEEING THE PRODUCT CONFORMS TO SPECIFICATION AND IS SAFE FOR USE. AS A RESULT OF THE INVESTIGATION, THE MIXING TEMPERATURE AND TIME PROFILES WERE TESTED UNDER ENGINEERING STUDIES TO FIND THE OPTIMUM SET POINT AND ALLOWABLE RANGE TO PREVENT THE CHARRING OF ANY OF THE RAW MATERIALS. THIS OPTIMUM SETTING HAS BEEN FULLY VALIDATED AND THE CHANGE IS AWAITING REGULATORY BODY APPROVAL TO BEGIN PRODUCTION. IN ADDITION, THE CLEANING FREQUENCY OF THE MIXER HAS BEEN INCREASED TO EVERY TWO BATCH RUNS TO ENSURE NO POTENTIAL CHARRED MATERIAL MAY BEGIN TO BUILD UP AND EVENTUALLY BECOME PRESENT IN OUR DRESSINGS. PRODUCT MONITORING REVIEWS WILL MONITOR FOR PRODUCT TRENDS IF THIS ISSUE WERE TO REOCCUR. TO DATE NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN RECEIVED. SHOULD ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOME AVAILABLE, A FOLLOW-UP REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED. (B)(4)."
