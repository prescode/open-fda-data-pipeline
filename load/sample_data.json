ACCORDING TO LITERATURE REVIEW, AND AS DOCUMENTED IN A CLINICAL TECHNICAL SUMMARY WRITTEN BY EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES, STROKE IS RECOGNIZED IN THE LITERATURE AS A WELL-KNOWN COMPLICATION IN A SMALL NUMBER OF PATIENTS UNDERGOING TAVR. RISK FACTORS CORRELATING WITH A NUMBER OF PATIENT CO-MORBIDITIES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED. ALTHOUGH IN MANY CASES THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE EVENT IS UNABLE TO BE DETERMINED, STROKES DURING TAVR ARE UNDOUBTEDLY MULTIFACTORIAL, THE DOMINANT ETIOLOGY LIKELY BEING INTRA-PROCEDURE EMBOLIC EVENTS. A TRANSCRANIAL DOPPLER STUDY DURING TAVR DEMONSTRATED THAT THE MAJORITY OF PROCEDURAL EMBOLIC EVENTS OCCURRED DURING BALLOON VALVULOPLASTY, MANIPULATION OF CATHETERS ACROSS THE AORTIC VALVE, AND VALVE IMPLANTATION. AN ANALYSIS IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING VALVE SURGERY REVEALED FOUR BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS AND TWO PROCEDURAL EVENTS THAT WERE ASSOCIATED WITH EARLY POST-PROCEDURE STROKE: FEMALE SEX, EF < 30%, DIABETES, AGE OLDER THAN 70 YEARS, BYPASS PROCEDURE TIME> 120 MIN, AND CALCIFICATION OF THE ASCENDING AORTA. PREDICTORS OF LATE STROKE HAVE INCLUDED FEMALE SEX, AGE OLDER THAN 75 YEARS, ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, AND A HISTORY OF OR CURRENT SMOKING. THERE WERE NO IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES IN THE FREQUENCY OF LATE STROKES BETWEEN TAVR AND AVR PATIENTS.
